4. Error, the variable result is declared with let within a block that line 13 is not a part of. Therefore at line 13 'result' is not defined.
5. There is an error at line 7 as the line is attempting to change the value of 'result' but 'result' is a constant and therefore can not be changed. Therefore line 9 does not run.
6. For the same reason above line 13 does not run.
